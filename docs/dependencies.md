# Dependencies

JIXO relies on several key dependencies to function correctly. While these dependencies are managed through npm, we strongly recommend using `pnpx jixo` to run the CLI.

## Why Use pnpx?

- **Latest Version:** `pnpx` ensures you always have access to the latest version of JIXO without requiring a global installation.
- **No Installation Required:** You don't need to install JIXO globally, keeping your environment clean.
- **Simplified Usage:** Running `pnpx jixo` is as simple as `jixo`, but with the added benefits of version management and dependency resolution.

## Core Dependencies

JIXO depends on the following:

- **Node.js:** JIXO requires Node.js to run. Please ensure you have a compatible version installed.
- **pnpm:** While npm is supported, we recommend using pnpm for optimal dependency management.

Please refer to the `jixo doctor` command for checking your environment for these dependencies.
