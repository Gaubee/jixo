以下是最新 JIXO-V3 代码，请务必以我最新的代码为基础来进行开发。：

[`next/src/**/*.ts`](@FILE)

但是我在测试的时候发现了一些问题。

我在 demo 文件夹中运行了 index.demo.ts 这段代码，我们一起分析一下：

终端输出：

你先不要急着输出代码，先一起来分析一下，这里头存在哪些问题，需要我们去改进的？

我个人认为有几点值得讨论的方向：

- 🏗️ **架构**: 为 PlannerAgent 注入 `workDir` 上下文，确保其生成的路径在沙箱内。
- 🐛 **修复**: 增强 ExecutorAgent 的指令，使其能正确处理并报告工具错误，杜绝成功幻觉。
- 🧠 **重构**: 优化 PlannerAgent 的故障恢复逻辑，使其能够区分瞬时错误和代码错误，并做出更智能的规划决策。
- 🧠 **重构**: 优化 PlannerAgent 的提示词与输出，能够在details中提供详细的开发计划，该计划可以让 Executor 的执行更加的清晰明了，避免幻觉，同时也可以给Reviewer提供一个验收标准。
  - details 可能是多行文本，我们之前在 logSerializer 使用拼接的方式可能不再适用。我建议使用 unified 和其生态（包括remark、remark-stringify 等）来构建 markdown-ast，然后输出markdown内容。
- 🏗️ **架构**: ExecutorAgent 和 ReviewerAgent 的 generate 没有和 PlannerAgent 那样都使用结构化输出，可能会影响Agent的协作，应该统一使用结构化输出，使得输出更加高效。

你的建议呢，我希望看到你的补充。
